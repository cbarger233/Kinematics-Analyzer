# Kinematics-Analyzer

This notebook is a GUI-driven application that allows a user to enter initial conditions for a projectile being launched. The initial conditions are the angle at which the projectile is launched (in degrees), the initial height, and the initial velocity. The user of the program can also change the gravity if they wish to do so, but the default is set to -9.81 (the average acceleration due to Earth's gravity in meters per second squared).

The notebook outputs information on the projectile, including the x- and y-position and velocity function for multiple angles, including the one the user inputs.

The motion of the projectile is plotted at the end.
